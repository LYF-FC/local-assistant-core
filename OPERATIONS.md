# Operations and recovery boundary

Use synthetic data until independent deployment/security/recovery acceptance is complete. Never run destructive tests against an existing installation. Review migrations before applying them and use independent backups. Ordinary SQL seals do not constrain a trusted database superuser that changes triggers.

Restores can resurrect older content, sessions and pending intent. Stop consumers, quarantine restored access and follow the retained technical recovery guides before any deliberate restart. Downloaded files, historical backups and WAL may retain forgotten content. No physical secure-erasure/latest-backup certificate is claimed.

- [Restored sessions](docs/RESTORED_SESSION_QUARANTINE.md).
- [Work source/backup recovery](docs/WORK_SOURCE_CHECKPOINTS.md).
- [Document limitations](docs/DOCUMENT_LIBRARY.md).

Never cache databases, authentication outcomes or test results to accelerate CI. Production/package certification needs full exact-main evidence and separately reviewed host/key/recovery procedures.
